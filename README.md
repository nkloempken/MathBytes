# MathBytes

Math Bytes was a project for my Software Engineering course at the University of Puget Sound in 2019. Our group laid out our plan, and built the game from scratch in Java. We decided to just make a windowed game with Java built-in features. It features a login system that just uses a text file to store usernames and passwords, but if done as a real project, we would have used a server, or cloud service of some kind.

This project helped us learn the Agile development process, and allowed us to work as a team to put together a larger scale project then we could have on our own. In the end, we met all of our main goals, and added most of the extra features that we were hoping to put into it.
